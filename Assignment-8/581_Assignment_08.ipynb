Since we already know there are three varieties of Irises embodied in the [Iris dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_iris.html), use the whole unlabeled dataset with $k=3$ on an instance of the [`KMeans`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html) estimator. Evaluate the performance of the model using as many metrics as you deem appropriate.\n",
        "2.   Confirm if $k=3$ is the optimum value for $k$ on the unlabeled version of the [Iris dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_iris.html). Use the Silhouette Coefficient as a metric similar to the examples shown in our [PML 10 jupyter notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/bjuliano/ad20bea98c646a2ccd522b4a91a70783/pml-10-unsupervised-learning-clustering-using-k-means.ipynb).\n",
